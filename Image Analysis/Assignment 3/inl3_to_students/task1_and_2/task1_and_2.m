% For the report, in addition to reporting above error rates (and
% commenting on them!), you should also manually select two images from X,
% one image of a face, and one image of a non-face. Begin by reshaping each
% such column from 361x1 to 19x19, so that you can show them using matlab's
% function "imagesc". (See "reshape" in Matlab for how to reshape a vector to a
% matrix). Provide both these images in your report INCLUDING WHAT YOUR
% MODEL PREDICTS THE RESPECTIVE IMAGES TO BE. Hopefully your model will say
% that the face is a face, and that the non-face is a non-face, but it's
% not certain of course. Make sure that the two images are extracted from
% X_test, and not X_train. Write code for this below! 

%% plotting images of fave and non-face from the test set

face_index = find(Y_test == 1);
face = X_test(:,face_index(5));
face = reshape(face,19,[]);
imagesc(face)
% modelpredict = classify(face,classification_data)
title("My model predicted this correctly as a face")

%%
notface_index = find(Y_test ~= 1);
notface = X_test(:,notface_index(1));
notface = reshape(notface,19,[]);
imagesc(notface)
%  modelpredict2 = classify(notface,classification_data)
title("My model predicted this correctly as not a face")
